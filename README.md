# Barkduino
Barkduino is a behavior-driven robot companion built on Arduino. It mimics dog-like gestures—sleeping, standing, waiting—without looking like a dog. Modular, expressive, and creatively designed, Barkduino is a playful robotics platform for gesture-based interaction and emotional feedback.
